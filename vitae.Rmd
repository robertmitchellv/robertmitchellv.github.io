## <i class="fa fa-compass fa-lg"></i>  Personal Philosophy

<br>

<ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> I believe that the 21st century requires a more multifaceted toolkit if we hope to solve complex challenges--process and task oriented approaches balanced within a framework that fosters strategic thinking.  That interdisciplinary relationships can be strengthened through active community participation--working toward something with the shared value of doing good.
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> I bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm to the projects that I become involved in.  I thrive in situations that require imagination and innovation.  My interests are varied; among my passions I would list: academic inquiry, classical and contemporary thought, the music and cuisine of other cultures, the arts, traveling, languages, and social justice.  I believe that our most vulnerable deserve respect and to be treated with dignity and fairness.
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> Ultimately I hope that the work I do is helpful--that it enables discovery or provides clarity.  I hope to bring together practical and principled approaches and I hope to further grow as this philosophy guides me.

## <i class="fa fa-child fa-lg"></i> Interests

<br>

  <ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> Learning more about statistics and data science; particularly its applications in R.  I am more and more becoming interested in Bayesian approaches.  
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> Coding: I will likely never code as neatly as an engineer but I try to incorporate software engineering best practices as I can--I am very keen to become more proficient with workflows in `airflow`, deploying APIs to `AWS`, and taking on more data engineering as practicable.
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> Design: I love typefaces and modernist design, in another life I would love to work as a designer or artist so it is something I passionately admire and sometimes try to do when time permits.
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i> Exploration: I like to explore other places through travel and food; ideologies through reading and communicating, and world through science and discovery!
