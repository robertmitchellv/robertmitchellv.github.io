> This site is an avenue for me to share either data analysis techniques I find novel or interesting and/or ideas or thoughts from my undergrad background in continental philosophy and French / German literature.  Sometimes I find these two areas of interest to overlap and other times I elect to dedicate a post to just one of my pursuits.

<h3>THE BRIEF BIO</h3>

<br>

> I am a father and husband who is passionate about code, complexity, design, dichotomy busting, cuisine, travel, and striving for balance across the board in my life.  I love conceptual thinking and am always working to expand my worldview through the acquisition of knowledge.  With this site, I hope to document what I learn and share what I know.

<br>

<h3>STILL CURIOUS? READ ON:</h3>

<br>

My Master’s degree is in Information Science (MSIS).  Furthermore, I also completed both the Information Systems program of study; a narrower focus within the MSIS degree as well as a Graduate Academic Certificate (GAC) in Digital Content Management.  The MSIS is designed for information work in many different fields from information brokerage, database analytics, chief information officer, user experience designer, information architect, knowledge manager, system librarian, and many more.  The information systems track taught me how to support my organization to gain strategic and tactical competitive advantages, which we can call knowledge management or business intelligence.  It supports more technical knowledge and builds more technical skills than the other tracks within the MSIS.  Last, the GAC in Digital Content Management provided me with a theoretical foundation and conceptual toolkit to help me manage digital content, build applications, and develop services that respond to institutional and individual user needs.

<br>

I hope to contribute posts on my site that interact with my interdisciplinary interests with special focus on the semantic relationships between objects and concepts.  I’m not always as interested in the epistemological aspect of things as I might appear–really I think I enjoy metaphysical speculation (otherwise, why would I have become interested in philosophy at all?).  I believe that everything is connected, and the 21st century will be about discovering these connections—hopefully I can be a part of this.
