Since `plotly` 4.0+ is so different[^1] and the documentation is still rolling out[^2] I wanted to challenge myself to make something complicated to better understand how things have changed.  I think [the Impact of Vaccines](http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/) visualizations are some of the best examples of how powerful data visualization can be--it becomes difficult to mount an counter argument after seeing them.  So, here goes!\n\n<br>\n\nIn order to get the data for this visualization you will need to create a free account over at [Project Tyco](www.website.com).  You can download all the datasets if you'd like but I'm just going to use the Polio data set.  These are the packages that I'm using:\n\n<br>\n\n__Load Packages__\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(plotly)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n\nI should probably get in the habit of inspecting the `csv` files in vim before loading them so I can decide how I want to read in the file.  In this case, using the `readr` package, you'll need to set a couple of options: first you'll need to set the `skip` argument to `2` since there are two lines of metadata about the data set.  The second argument is `na`, which takes a simple vector for weirdly encoded `NA` values.  In this data set, `-` is used for `NA`, so you'll set the `na` argument to `c(\"-\", \"NA\")` to ensure those values are handled correctly.  The third arugment to set is `col_types`, which is an awesome way to control your data types during reading so you do less old-fashioned type conversion _Ã  la_ `df$x <- as.numeric(df$x)`, which I don't think anyone likes doing.  `readr`'s heuristic guesses correctly for all columns except the variables for `ALASKA` and `HAWAII`.  I'm not exactly sure why, but my guess is that the `0.00` values mess with the `NA` checks that `readr` performs.  Luckily, we don't have to know the _why_ since we can just change those two and leave `readr` to do its job on the others:\n\n<br>\n\n__Read in the data__\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolio <- read_csv(\"POLIO_Incidence_1928-1969_20160904215505.csv\", \n                  skip = 2, na = c(\"-\", \"NA\"),\n                  col_types = list(\n                    ALASKA = col_double(),\n                    HAWAII = col_double()\n))\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nNow, the way this data set is structures is super weird.  In order to get it into a tidy format we'll need to use `tidyr`; specifically the `gather` function.  But I don't want to pass through all the variable names, so with a little lazy figuring out, I just kept changing the numbers until I found the right range in numbers with `dplyr`'s `select` function since it uses the same `start_row:end_row` notation:\n\n<br>\n\n__Find the index for the columns you want to `gather` with `tidyr`__\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolio %>% select(3:53) %>% head()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-a870446194178965f469\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto;\" class=\"datatables html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-a870446194178965f469\">{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"vertical\":false,\"extensions\":[\"FixedColumns\"],\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\"],[0,0,0.04,0,0,0],[null,null,null,null,null,null],[0,0,0,0.24,0.24,0],[0,0,0,0.11,0,0],[0.17,0.15,0.11,0.07,0.32,0.22],[0.39,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.1],[0,0,0.06,0.06,0.13,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[null,null,null,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0.03,0,null,0,0,0],[null,null,null,null,null,null],[0,0,0,0,0,null],[0.03,0.01,0.03,0.05,0.04,0.03],[0.03,0.03,0.03,0.12,0,0],[0.08,null,null,0,0.04,0],[0,0.22,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0.05,0,0,0,0],[0,0.13,0,0,0.38,0],[0.06,0.06,0,0,0.12,0],[0.14,0.14,0.07,0.02,0.02,0.05],[0.04,0.04,0.02,0.02,0.04,0.06],[0,0.04,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0.03,0.06,0.03,0.06,0,0],[0.18,0,0.18,0,0,0],[0.07,0.07,0,0,0.15,0.07],[null,null,null,null,null,null],[null,null,null,0,0,0],[0.08,0.03,0,0.03,0.03,0],[0,0,0,0,0.48,0],[0.08,0.05,0.03,0.06,0.07,0.03],[0,0.03,0,0,0,0],[null,0.45,0,0.15,0,0],[0.02,null,0.06,0,0.03,0.05],[0,0.04,0,0.09,0,0.04],[0.64,0.43,1.07,0.53,0.32,0.21],[0,0.03,0.02,0.02,0,0.04],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[0.06,0.06,0.35,0.23,0.17,0.06],[0,0,0,0,0.15,0.29],[0.04,0.04,0,0.04,0,0.04],[0.05,0.04,0,0.05,0.05,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0.2],[0,0,0,0,0,0],[null,null,null,null,null,0.04],[0.26,0.39,0.13,0.06,0.13,0.06],[0.06,0.24,0.12,0.12,0.06,0],[0.03,0.03,0.03,0,0.03,0.14],[0,0,0,0,0,0]],\"container\":\"<table class=\\\"display\\\">\\n  <thead>\\n    <tr>\\n      <th> <\\/th>\\n      <th>ALABAMA<\\/th>\\n      <th>ALASKA<\\/th>\\n      <th>ARIZONA<\\/th>\\n      <th>ARKANSAS<\\/th>\\n      <th>CALIFORNIA<\\/th>\\n      <th>COLORADO<\\/th>\\n      <th>CONNECTICUT<\\/th>\\n      <th>DELAWARE<\\/th>\\n      <th>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA<\\/th>\\n      <th>FLORIDA<\\/th>\\n      <th>GEORGIA<\\/th>\\n      <th>HAWAII<\\/th>\\n      <th>IDAHO<\\/th>\\n      <th>ILLINOIS<\\/th>\\n      <th>INDIANA<\\/th>\\n      <th>IOWA<\\/th>\\n      <th>KANSAS<\\/th>\\n      <th>KENTUCKY<\\/th>\\n      <th>LOUISIANA<\\/th>\\n      <th>MAINE<\\/th>\\n      <th>MARYLAND<\\/th>\\n      <th>MASSACHUSETTS<\\/th>\\n      <th>MICHIGAN<\\/th>\\n      <th>MINNESOTA<\\/th>\\n      <th>MISSISSIPPI<\\/th>\\n      <th>MISSOURI<\\/th>\\n      <th>MONTANA<\\/th>\\n      <th>NEBRASKA<\\/th>\\n      <th>NEVADA<\\/th>\\n      <th>NEW HAMPSHIRE<\\/th>\\n      <th>NEW JERSEY<\\/th>\\n      <th>NEW MEXICO<\\/th>\\n      <th>NEW YORK<\\/th>\\n      <th>NORTH CAROLINA<\\/th>\\n      <th>NORTH DAKOTA<\\/th>\\n      <th>OHIO<\\/th>\\n      <th>OKLAHOMA<\\/th>\\n      <th>OREGON<\\/th>\\n      <th>PENNSYLVANIA<\\/th>\\n      <th>RHODE ISLAND<\\/th>\\n      <th>SOUTH CAROLINA<\\/th>\\n      <th>SOUTH DAKOTA<\\/th>\\n      <th>TENNESSEE<\\/th>\\n      <th>TEXAS<\\/th>\\n      <th>UTAH<\\/th>\\n      <th>VERMONT<\\/th>\\n      <th>VIRGINIA<\\/th>\\n      <th>WASHINGTON<\\/th>\\n      <th>WEST VIRGINIA<\\/th>\\n      <th>WISCONSIN<\\/th>\\n      <th>WYOMING<\\/th>\\n    <\\/tr>\\n  <\\/thead>\\n<\\/table>\",\"options\":{\"dom\":\"t\",\"scrollX\":true,\"fixedColumns\":true,\"style\":\"bootstrap\",\"width\":5,\"searching\":false,\"class\":\"table-hover\",\"columnDefs\":[{\"className\":\"dt-right\",\"targets\":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51]},{\"orderable\":false,\"targets\":0}],\"order\":[],\"autoWidth\":false,\"orderClasses\":false}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n__Use `gather` to transform data, `rename` columns, and make sure `cases` is numeric__\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolio <- polio %>% gather(3:53, key=\"state\", value=\"cases\") \npolio <- rename(polio, year = YEAR, week = WEEK, state = state, cases = cases)\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis is a quick function to get the states data in the right format to use R's built in `state.abb` data, which I found online.

a lot going on here, but the code is not too verbose (at least I don't think).  I add the `year` and `state` data to the regular `plot_ly` function while placing the `z` data that transforms it into a heatmap in `add_heatmap`.  Even though I'm pushing the annotation outside of the plot, plotly doesn't add any more y ticks.  However, in `add_segments` if I used `y = ~min(state), yend = ~max(state)` there would have been two extra y ticks on the bottom (0 and 1).  This is annoying and I tried many different things to get everything to behave nicely but it's hard to get a heatmap and lines and annotations to work well together.  My workaround is to just make the segment line a little shorter, but I don't think it looks too bad.\n\n<br>\n\nLet me know if you have any thoughts about improving things in the comments!\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n[^1]: http://moderndata.plot.ly/upgrading-to-plotly-4-0-and-above/\n[^2]: `git clone` and `git pull` often: https://cpsievert.github.io/plotly_book/\n",
