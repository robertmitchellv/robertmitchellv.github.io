That interdisciplinary relationships can be strengthened through active community participation--working toward something with the shared value of doing good.\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} I bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm to the projects that I become involved in. I thrive in situations that require imagination and innovation. My interests are varied; among my passions I would list: academic inquiry, classical and contemporary thought, the music and cuisine of other cultures, the arts, traveling, languages, and social justice. I believe that our most vulnerable deserve respect and to be treated with dignity and fairness.\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} Ultimately I hope that the work I do is helpful--that it enables discovery or provides clarity. I hope to bring together practical and principled approaches and I hope to further grow as this philosophy guides me.\n\n<br>\n\n## {{< fa magic >}} Personal Skills\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} I am dedicated and hard working--a good communicator and active community participant. I work well on team efforts and projects with the ultimate aim of using data for social good.\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} I am:\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} creative\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} honest\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} friendly\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} enthusiastic\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} keen to learn new things and take on new roles\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} reliable\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} a lateral thinker \n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} motivated<br><br>\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} I am able to: \n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} speak and read French \n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} read and understand some German\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} listen to and follow instructions accurately\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} work cooperatively\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} take on new challenges\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} complete tasks\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} support others\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} identify new innovations and technologies while working toward implementing them\n  + {{< fa long-arrow-right >}} be proactive\n\n<br>\n\n## {{< fa code >}} Technical Skills\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} __Web Technologies:__ HTML, CSS, Javascript; Quarto publishing; Rmarkdown Websites, Dashboards in R with `shiny`/`flexdashboard` that support `crosstalk`, and interactive data visualization with Plotly; Static Site Generators, i.e., Pelican, Jekyll, and others; Traditional CMSs like Wordpress and Drupal; previous coursework in Information Architecture and UX/UI design.\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} __Coding:__ R, Python, and Javascript.\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} __OSs:__ macOS, Linux, Windows, and containers. Within the Linux ecosystem, I have experience with Debian based distributions as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I love the terminal and wish `vim` bindings were universal.\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} __Data:__ Relational Databases (data modeling and SQL); Extract-Transfer-Load (ETL) and Extract-Load-Transfer (ELT) strategies for data engineering--specifically with Apache Airflow for ETL and Data Build Tool (dbt) for ELT; information retrieval; taxonomies and ontologies; and, knowledge organization theory.\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} __Data Science:__ both R and Python are a big part of my workflow from reading in data, transforming and 'tidying' data, exploring and visualizing data, modeling, reporting, presenting, and tying it all together in a dashboard. In connection to R, I am a proponent of the `tidyverse` framework for its unifying API. With respect to Python, I enjoy using `polars`, `pyjanitor`, `pymc`, and `plotly` to work in equivalent ways. I'm honestly happy working in both languages.\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} __Metadata schemas:__ knowledge of RDF, OWL, SPARQL, AACR2, RDA, MODS, METS, and PREMIS\n\n<br>\n\n## {{< fa graduation-cap >}} Education\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} __University of North Texas__ | Master of Science in Information Science (2013) <small>Information Systems track</small>\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} __University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)__ | Bachelor of Arts in French and comparative literature (2008 / double major)\n\n* {{< fa angle-double-right >}} __Universit√© de la Sorbonne Nouvelle__ (Paris III) | Student exchange (2006--2007)\n\n<br>\n\n## {{< fa institution >}} Work Experience\n\n<!-- DPH / Data Scientist -->\n<ul>  \n  <h3>County of Los Angeles, Department of Public Health_Los Angeles, CA</h3>\n  <h4>Data Scientist Supervisor_Data Science and Systems (DSS) team; Acute Communicable Disease Control (ACDC) / July 2020--Present</h4>\n  <ul>\n  {{< fa angle-double-right >}} using expert knowledge of and experience in data, statistical modeling, and machine learning methods; programming languages, packages/libraries, and big-data engineering solutions; manage and implement highly technical and complex data science projects from defining the vision to operationalizing solutions to ensure desired outcomes are achieved. \n  </ul>\n  <ul>\n  {{< fa angle-double-right >}} provides both technical and administrative supervision to the DSS team of four to five staff (on average) as we plan, develop, and implement data science projects, data engineering pipelines, and dashboards/visual analytics.
