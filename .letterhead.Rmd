Dear Kirat Doshi,
<br>
<br>

I'm excited to be applying for the Senior Anlyst role at OneGoal. My resume with detailed work experience, personal philosophy, and list of hard and soft skills is enclosed. Based on the job description I think this position will be challenging, dynamic, and full of opportunity to grow with OneGoal! Specifically, I'm drawn to the groath the company has experienced and the desire to use data and technology to augment what is traditionally provided in the space. I am looking to grow my skill set with a company that is ambitious to tackle a challenging domain while also building data products that meet end user need.
<br>
<br>

I am an avid R user and enjoy leveraging the R ecosystem to accomplish tasks (including the maintenance of my website, resume, and the creation of this cover letter). There is so much opportunity to democratize data analysis and to empower folks within the enterprise to create meaningful insight. I see OneGoal as a place where I can continue to participate in meaningful work that helps empower folks--it's a strong motivator.
<br>
<br>

I would be happy to answer any questions substantive or otherwise--feel free to contact me directly via the information above.
<br>
<br>
<br>

Best,
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Robert Mitchell
