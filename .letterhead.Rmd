Dear Hiring Manager,
<br>
<br>

I'm applying for the Junior Data Scientist role. My resume with detailed work experience, personal philosophy, and list of hard and soft skills is enclosed. Based on the job description I think this position will be challenging, dynamic, and full of opportunity to grow with SCE! If you have a moment, I'd love to ask you more questions about the tools you're using and the types of projects I might be running if hired.
<br>
<br>

I would be happy to answer any questions substantive or otherwise--feel free to contact me directly via the information above.
<br>
<br>
<br>

Best,
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Robert Mitchell
