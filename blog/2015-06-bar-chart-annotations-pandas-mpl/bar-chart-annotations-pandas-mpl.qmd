This is a very old post. The `pandas` API has matured greatly and most of this is very outdated. This remains here as a record for myself

<br>

```{r setup, include=F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(python.reticulate = FALSE)
```

When I first started using Pandas, I loved how much easier it was to stick a plot method on a DataFrame or Series to get a better sense of what was going on.  However, I was not very impressed with what the plots looked like.  Any time I wanted to do something slightly different from the "Plotting" documentation on the pydata site, I found myself arm deep in MPL code that did not make any damn sense to me.  This was a problem for me, as I ended up spending way too much time trying to make small edits and not enough time working on the code I was trying to visualize.

<br>

One thing in particular bugged me.  I could find no easy to understand tutorial on annotating a bar chart on StackOverflow or any other site.  MPL had some documentation, but it was too confusing for me at the time.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to put some text right above my bars.  Since I would have loved to see a snippet of code to help me in my journey, I thought I would throw it together in a brief post so others could use my workaround.  

<br>

I warn you, it is not the most elegent solution, I am sure, but it worked for me when I needed to demonstrate the insight I had gained from a Healthcare Access and Utilization Survey (made up mostly of CHIS questions) to people in my department, my director, and her bosses.  Since I cannot share any of that data, I will use the [War of the Five Kings Dataset](https://github.com/chrisalbon/war_of_the_five_kings_dataset) that [Chris Albon](http://chrisalbon.com) made.  I love this data set because I am in the middle of book five of Game of Thrones, which provides a good amount of domain familiarity to enable jumping in easier.

<br>

#### Setup + Import Data

<br>

```{python, eval=F}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')
%matplotlib inline

# set jupyter's max row display
pd.set_option('display.max_row', 1000)

# set jupyter's max column width to 50
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 50)

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('site_content/data/5kings_battles_v1.csv')
```

<br>

#### First visualization with annotations

<br>

```{python, eval=F}
ax = data['region'].value_counts().plot(kind='barh', figsize=(10,7),
                                        color="coral", fontsize=13);
ax.set_alpha(0.8)
ax.set_title("Where were the battles fought?", fontsize=18)
ax.set_xlabel("Number of Battles", fontsize=18);
ax.set_xticks([0, 5, 10, 15, 20])

# create a list to collect the plt.patches data
totals = []

# find the values and append to list
for i in ax.patches:
    totals.append(i.get_width())

# set individual bar lables using above list
total = sum(totals)

# set individual bar lables using above list
for i in ax.patches:
    # get_width pulls left or right; get_y pushes up or down
    ax.text(i.get_width()+.3, i.get_y()+.38, \
            str(round((i.get_width()/total)*100, 2))+'%', fontsize=15,
color='dimgrey')

# invert for largest on top 
ax.invert_yaxis()
```

<br>

The image above is the output from the Jupyter notebook.  I think it is super clear and gives a lot of information about where the battles were fought.  However, I am very parital to horizontal bar charts, as I really think they are easier to read, however, I understand that a lot of people would rather see this chart implemented in a regular bar chart.  So, here is the code to do that; you will notice that a few things have changed in order to create the annotation.

<br>
  
```{python, eval=F}
ax = data['region'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10,7),
                                        color="coral", fontsize=13);
ax.set_alpha(0.8)
ax.set_title("Where were the battles fought?", fontsize=18)
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Battles", fontsize=18);
ax.set_yticks([0, 5, 10, 15, 20])

# create a list to collect the plt.patches data
totals = []

# find the values and append to list
for i in ax.patches:
    totals.append(i.get_height())

# set individual bar lables using above list
total = sum(totals)

# set individual bar lables using above list
for i in ax.patches:
    # get_x pulls left or right; get_height pushes up or down
    ax.text(i.get_x()-.03, i.get_height()+.5, \
            str(round((i.get_height()/total)*100, 2))+'%', fontsize=15,
                color='dimgrey')
```

I play around with the mpl.text() numbers for almost each chart.  They are never exactly where they need to be, which often means moving thigs around a hair here and .03 there.  You can add or subtract, which means you can also do this:

<br>

```{python, eval=F}
ax = data['attacker_outcome'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10,7),
                                                  color="indigo", fontsize=13);
ax.set_alpha(0.8)
ax.set_title("Do attackers usually win or loose?", fontsize=18)
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Battles", fontsize=18);
ax.set_yticks([0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40])

# create a list to collect the plt.patches data
totals = []

# find the values and append to list
for i in ax.patches:
    totals.append(i.get_height())

# set individual bar lables using above list
total = sum(totals)

# set individual bar lables using above list
for i in ax.patches:
    # get_x pulls left or right; get_height pushes up or down
    ax.text(i.get_x()+.12, i.get_height()-3, \
            str(round((i.get_height()/total)*100, 2))+'%', fontsize=22,
                color='white')
```

If you are like me, often you like to isolate a categorical value in one column and see what the rest of the dataframe looks like in light of that.  It is a simply way of drilling down, but a percentage really would not be as appropriate as a count.  Here is an example of using a count rather than a percentage:

<br>

```{python, eval=F}
losses = data[data['attacker_outcome'].str.contains("loss", na=False)]

ax = losses['attacker_king'].value_counts().plot(kind='barh', figsize=(10,7),
                                                 color="slateblue", fontsize=13);
ax.set_alpha(0.8)
ax.set_title("Who were the attackers who lost?", fontsize=18)
ax.set_xlabel("Number of Battles", fontsize=18);
ax.set_xticks([0, 5])

# set individual bar lables using above list
for i in ax.patches:
    # get_width pulls left or right; get_y pushes up or down
    ax.text(i.get_width()+.1, i.get_y()+.31, \
            str(round((i.get_width()), 2)), fontsize=15, color='dimgrey')

# invert for largest on top 
ax.invert_yaxis()
```

<br>

<br>

You can also just project a couple columns from those that lost to compare a couple of values; I think bar charts are great for this purpose.  I am not sure what the best way would be do accomplish this, but here is my implementation:

<br>

```{python, eval=F}
ax = losses[['attacker_size', 'defender_size']].plot(kind='bar',
              figsize=(15,7), color=['dodgerblue', 'slategray'], fontsize=13);
ax.set_alpha(0.8)
ax.set_title("For Attacker Losses, What was the Difference in Size?",
fontsize=18)
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Troops", fontsize=18);
ax.set_yticks([0, 20000, 40000, 60000, 80000, 100000, 120000, 140000])
ax.set_xticklabels(["Robb v Joff/Tommen", "Joff/Tommen v Robb", 
                    "Stannis v Joff/Tommen", "Robb v Joff/Tommen", 
                    "Stannis v Mance"], rotation=0, fontsize=11)

# set individual bar lables using above list
for i in ax.patches:
    # get_x pulls left or right; get_height pushes up or down
    ax.text(i.get_x()+.04, i.get_height()+12000, \
            str(round((i.get_height()), 2)), fontsize=11, color='dimgrey',
                rotation=45)
```

<br>

<br>

There is a handy 'rotation' option for the MPL plots that you can use that I feel works well when using a regular bar chart.  I really dislike tilting my head to one side to try and read what it says!  Also, it is easy to rename the columns!  I did not realize how simple it was, which makes me feel silly.

<br>

Here is the chart done horizontally, which I prefer:

<br>

```{python, eval=F}
ax = losses[['attacker_size', 'defender_size']].plot(kind='barh',
              figsize=(10,7), color=['dodgerblue', 'slategray'], fontsize=13);
ax.set_alpha(0.8)
ax.set_title("For Attacker Losses, What was the Difference in Size?",
fontsize=18)
ax.set_xlabel("Number of Troops", fontsize=18)
ax.set_ylabel("First Name is Attacker", fontsize=18)
ax.set_xticks([0, 20000, 40000, 60000, 80000, 100000, 120000, 140000])
ax.set_yticklabels(["Robb v Joff/Tommen", "Joff/Tommen v Robb", 
                    "Stannis v Joff/Tommen", "Robb v Joff/Tommen", 
                    "Stannis v Mance"])

# set individual bar lables using above list
for i in ax.patches:
    # get_width pulls left or right; get_y pushes up or down
    ax.text(i.get_width()+700, i.get_y()+.18, \
            str(round((i.get_width()), 2)), fontsize=11, color='dimgrey')

# invert for largest on top 
ax.invert_yaxis()
```

I hope this is helpful for anyone out there trying to create little annotations for their visualizations.  I feel like this is just a little bit of extra work but it keeps me from having to write JavaScript, which is worth a little copy paste action.  When I have time, I would like to create a class with methods so I do not have to keep doing a copy/paste job in my Jupyter notebook.

<br>

Let me know if there is an easier way to do this, I would be grateful!

Here is a link to the
[notebook](https://github.com/robertmitchellv/robertmitchellv.github.io/blob/master/content/notebooks/Five-Kings-Data-Analysis.ipynb) on my GitHub if you are interested in playing with it a bit more.  I stopped when I was trying to figure out how to turn the dates into a Pandas 'period_range'.
